//! # Ownership Basics
//!
//! Welcome to Rust's superpower! Ownership is what makes Rust special.
//! While other languages either make you manage memory manually (hello,
//! segfaults!) or use garbage collection (goodbye, predictable performance!),
//! Rust found a third way.
//!
//! The ownership system was inspired by ideas from academia, particularly
//! linear types and affine types. But don't worry about the theory -
//! you'll build intuition through practice! Think of it as Rust being
//! a very organized friend who always knows who's borrowing what.
//!
//! Once you master ownership, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it! ðŸ¦€

/// Takes ownership of a String and modifies it.
/// When you pass a String to this function, ownership transfers.
fn take_ownership(s: String) -> String {
    // Add " - owned by Rust!" to the end and return
    unimplemented!()
}

/// Borrows a string reference without taking ownership.
/// The original string remains valid after this function returns.
fn borrow_string(s: &str) -> usize {
    // Return the length using .len()
    unimplemented!()
}

/// Takes a mutable reference to modify the string in place.
/// The &mut allows us to change the string's contents.
fn mutate_string(s: &mut String) {
    // Add " - now with 100% more crab!" using .push_str()
    unimplemented!()
}
